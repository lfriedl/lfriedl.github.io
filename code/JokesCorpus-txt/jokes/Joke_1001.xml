     An old farmer went to town to see a movie. The ticket girl said, "Sir, what is that on your shoulder?"   The old farmer said, "That is my pet rooster, Chuckie. Wherever I go, Chuckie goes."   "I'm sorry, Sir," said the ticket girl, "We can't allow animals in the theater. Not even a pet chicken."   The old farmer went around the corner and stuffed the chicken down his pants. He returned to the booth, bought a ticket and entered the theater. He sat down next to two old emergency room nurses named Mildred and Marge.   The movie started and the chicken began to squirm. The old farmer un-zipped his pants so Chuckie could stick his head out and watch the movie.   "Marge," whispered Mildred.   "What?" said Marge.   "I think the guy next to me is a pervert."   "What makes you think so?" asked Marge.   "He unzipped his pants and he has his thing out," whispered Mildred.   "Well, don't worry about it," said Marge, "At our age it isn't anything we haven't seen before."   "Yes," said Mildred, "But this one's eating my popcorn!"
