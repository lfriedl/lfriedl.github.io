     A small tourist hotel was all abuzz about an afternoon wedding where the groom was 95 and the bride was 23.   The groom looked pretty feeble and the feeling was that the wedding night might kill him, because his bride was a healthy, vivacious young woman.   But lo and behold, the next morning, the bride came down the main staircase slowly, step by step, hanging onto the banister for dear life.   She finally managed to get to the counter of the little shop in the hotel. The clerk looked really concerned, "Whatever happened to you, honey? You look like you've been wrestling an alligator!"   The bride groaned, hung on to the counter and managed to speak, "Ohhh God! He told me he'd been saving up for 75 years and I thought he meant his money!!"
