     There was once a young man who, in his youth, professed his desire to become a great writer.   When asked to define "great" he said, "I want to write stuff that the whole world will read, stuff that people will react to on a truly emotional level, stuff that will make them scream, cry, howl in pain and anger!"   He now works for Microsoft, writing error messages.
