     In a check out line the other day and the couple were arguing about whose turn it was to pay.   The clerk was kind of listening until she heard the lady said to the guy, "Stop being a scrote."   With a furrowed brow the clerk asked, "What is a scrote?"   Without missing a beat the lady responded, "Short for scrotum. He is somewhere between a prick and an asshole."
