     Here is this guy who really takes care of his body; he lifts weights and jogs five miles every day.   One morning, he looks into the mirror and admires his body. He notices that he is really sun tanned all over except one part and he decides to do something about it.   He goes to the beach, completely undresses and buries himself in the dand except for the one part sticking out.   Two little old ladies are strolling along the beach and one looks down and says, "There really is no justice in this world."   The other little old lady says, "What do you mean?"   The first little old lady says, "Look at that."   "When I was 10 years old, I was afraid of it."   "When I was 20 years old, I was curious about it."   "When I was 30 years old, I enjoyed it."   "When I was 40 years old, I asked for it."   "When I was 50 years old, I paid for it."   "When I was 60 years old, I prayed for it."   "When I was 70 years old, I forgot about it."   "And now that I'm 80, the damned things are growing wild!!"
