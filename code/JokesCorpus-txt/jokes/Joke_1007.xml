     Kenny, a city boy, moved to the country and purchased a donkey from an old farmer for $100. The farmer agreed to deliver the donkey the following day.   The next morning, the farmer drove up and said, "Sorry, son, but I have some bad news. The donkey died."   "Well, just return my money to me," Kenny said.   "Sorry, can't do that," said the farmer. "I already spent it."   "OK then, just unload the donkey," said Kenny.   "Whatcha gonna do with him?" asked the farmer.   "I'm going to raffle him off," Kenny replied.   "You can't raffle off a dead donkey!" the farmer exclaimed.   "Of course I can," replied Kenny. "Watch me. I just won't tell anybody he is dead."   A few weeks later, the farmer met up with Kenny and asked, "So, what happened with the dead donkey?"   "I raffled him off. I sold 500 tickets at two dollars a piece and made a profit of $898.00," explained Kenny.   "Didn't anyone complain?" inquired the farmer.   "Just the guy who won. So, I gave him his two dollars back," Kenny proudly replied.
