Aunt      Dear Editor,   I have two brothers, one works at Microsoft, the other was sentenced to death in the gas chamber.   My mother died of insanity when I was three years old, my two sisters are prostitutes and my father sells drugs.   Recently, I met a girl who was released from a reformatory where she served time for smothering her illegitimate child to death.   I love this girl very much and want to marry her.   My problem is this:   Shall I tell her about my brother who works at Microsoft?   Sincerely,  Larry
