     Recent Canadian government research has shown that cigarette smoking not only impairs sexual ability, it actually causes shrinkage of the male sexual "equipment."   Wow! If that is true, we need to get the word out ASAP! Maybe the warning on the cigarette packs should be updated to reflect this new information.   How about something like this:   * Warning: These cigarettes are king size -- how about you?   * Warning: Smoking sections in restaurants aren't the only things getting smaller.   * Warning: If you don't reduce your smoking, your smoking will reduce you.   * Warning: Smoking may lead to ridicule on your honeymoon.   * Warning: Smoke rises, but you may not.   * Warning: Second-hand smoke can be harmful to children -- That is.. if you're capable of conceiving any.   * Warning: Cigarettes get shorter the more you puff -- so do you.   * Warning: How can you enjoy a smoke afterwards, if there's no before?   * Warning: The only thing left after a smoke is a dead stub.   * Warning: Don't throw lit cigarettes in the urinal -- you might not have the range to put them out.
