You Know, The More You Make      "Salary Theorem" states that "Engineers and Scientists can never earn as much as Business Executives and Sales People."   This theorem can now be supported by a mathematical equation based on the following two postulates:   1. Knowledge is Power.  2. Time is Money.   As every engineer knows:  Power = Work / Time   Since:  Knowledge = Power  Time = Money   It follows that:  Knowledge = Work/Money.   Solving for Money, we get:  Money = Work / Knowledge.   Thus, as Knowledge approaches zero, Money approaches infinity, regardless of the amount of work done.   Conclusion:  The less you know,the more you make.
