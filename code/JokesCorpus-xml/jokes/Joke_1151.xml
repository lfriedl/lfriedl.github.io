Always. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Your last name stays put. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The garage is all yours. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Nobody secretly wonders if you swallow. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Wedding plans take care of themselves. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; You don't have to curl up next to a hairy ass every night. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Chocolate is just another snack. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; You can be president. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; You can wear a white shirt to a water park. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Foreplay is optional. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Car mechanics tell you the truth. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; You don't give a rat's ass if someone notices your new haircut. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The world is your urinal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Hot wax never comes near your pubic area. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; You never have to drive to another gas station because this one's just too icky. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Same work.. more pay. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Wrinkles add character. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; You don't have to leave the room to make emergency crotch adjustments. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Wedding Dress $2000; Tux rental $100. 'Nuff said.. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; If you retain water, it's in a canteen. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; People never glance at your chest when you're talking to them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Princess Di's death was just another obituary. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The occasional well-rendered belch is practically expected. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; New shoes don't cut, blister, or irreparably mangle your feet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Porn movies are designed with you in mind. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Your pals can be trusted never to trap you with: "So, notice anything different?" &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </joke>
