The doctor told the husband that they couldn't graft any skin from her body because she was too skinny. So the husband offered to donate some of his own skin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; However, the only skin on his body that the doctor felt was suitable would have to come from his buttocks. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The husband and wife agreed that they would tell no one about where the skin came from, and requested that the doctor also honor their secret. After all, this was a very delicate matter. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; After the surgery was completed, everyone was astounded at the woman's new beauty. She looked more beautiful than she ever had before! All her friends and relatives just went on and on about her youthful beauty! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; One day, she was alone with her husband, and she was overcome with emotion at his sacrifice. She said, "Dear, I just want to thank you for everything you did for me. How can I possibly repay you?" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "My darling," he replied, "I get all the thanks I need every time I see your mother kiss you on the cheek." &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </joke>
