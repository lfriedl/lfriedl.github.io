The farmer agreed to deliver the donkey the following day. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The next morning, the farmer drove up and said, "Sorry, son, but I have some bad news. The donkey died." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "Well, just return my money to me," Kenny said. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "Sorry, can't do that," said the farmer. "I already spent it." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "OK then, just unload the donkey," said Kenny. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "Whatcha gonna do with him?" asked the farmer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "I'm going to raffle him off," Kenny replied. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "You can't raffle off a dead donkey!" the farmer exclaimed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "Of course I can," replied Kenny. "Watch me. I just won't tell anybody he is dead." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; A few weeks later, the farmer met up with Kenny and asked, "So, what happened with the dead donkey?" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "I raffled him off. I sold 500 tickets at two dollars a piece and made a profit of $898.00," explained Kenny. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "Didn't anyone complain?" inquired the farmer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "Just the guy who won. So, I gave him his two dollars back," Kenny proudly replied. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </joke>
