I have two female talking parrots, but they only know how to say one thing." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "What do they say?" the priest inquired. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "They only know how to say, 'Hi, we're prostitutes. 'Want to have some fun?'" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "That's terrible!" the priest exclaimed, "but I have a solution to your problem. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Bring your two female parrots over to my house and I will put them with my two male talking parrots whom I taught to pray and read the bible. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; My parrots will teach your parrots to stop saying that terrible phrase and your female parrots will learn to praise and worship." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "Thank you!" the woman responded. The next day the woman brings her female parrots to the priest's house. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; His two male parrots are holding rosary beads and praying in their cage. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The lady puts her two female parrots in with the male parrots and the female parrots say,"Hi, we're prostitutes, want to have some fun?" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; One male parrot looks over at the other male parrot and exclaims, "Put the beads away. Our prayers have been answered!" &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </joke>
