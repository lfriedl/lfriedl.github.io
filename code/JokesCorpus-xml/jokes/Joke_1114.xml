A very attractive blonde woman arrived and bet twenty thousand dollars on a single roll of the dice. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; She said, "I hope you don't mind, but I feel much luckier when I'm completely nude". &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; With that she stripped from her neck down, rolled the dice and yelled, "Mama needs new clothes!" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Then she hollered "YES! YES! I WON! I WON!" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; She jumped up and down and hugged each of the dealers. With that she picked up all the money and clothes and quickly departed. The dealers just stared at &lt;br /&gt; each other dumbfounded. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Finally, one of them asked, "What did she roll?" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The other answered, "I thought YOU were watching!" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Moral: Not all blondes are dumb, but most men are gullible. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </joke>
