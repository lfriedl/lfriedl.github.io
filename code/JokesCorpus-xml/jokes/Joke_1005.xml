&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td colspan="2"&gt; A man, Bob, and his friend Joe went
out hunting. This was Joe's first time ever hunting, so he was following Bob's lead. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Bob saw a small herd of deer and told Joe to stay in the exact spot he was and to be quiet! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; After a few minutes, Bob heard a loud scream. He ran back and asked Joe what had happened. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Joe said "There was this snake and he slittered across my feet, but I never screamed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Then there was this bear that came up to me and snarled, but I never screamed." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "So then what did make you scream," Bob asked, exasperated. "Well," Joe continued, "two squirells crawled up my pants and I overheard them say, "Should we take them home or eat â€™em now?"" &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </joke>
