The doctor asks her what's wrong, why doesn't she want to have sex with her husband? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "Oh, that's easily explained. For the past six months," the wife says, "I've been taking a cab to work every morning. I don't have any money. The cab driver asks me, 'Are you going to pay today, or what?' So, I take an 'or what'." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "Then, when I get to work," she continues, "I'm late, so the boss asks me, 'Are we going to write this down in the book, or what?' So, I take an 'or what'. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I take a cab to go home after work and, as usual, I have no money. The cab driver asks me again, 'So, are you going to pay this time, or what?' Again, I take an 'or what'. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; So you see, doc, by the time I get home I'm all tired out and don't want it anymore." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "Yes, I see," replies the doctor. "So, are we going to tell your husband, or what?" </joke>
