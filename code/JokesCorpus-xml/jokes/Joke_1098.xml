"But then everything changed. That's why I'm here. I'm going to have a baby in three months." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "You must tell me what you did." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "I went to a faith healer." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "But I've tried that. My husband and I &lt;br /&gt; went to one for nearly a year and it didn't help a bit." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The other woman smiled and whispered, "Try going alone, next time, dearie." &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </joke>
