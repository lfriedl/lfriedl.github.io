Suddenly, the plane developed engine trouble. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In spite of the best efforts of the pilot, the plane started to go down. Finally, the pilot grabbed a parachute, yelled to the passengers that they had better jump, and bailed out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Unfortunately, there were only three parachutes remaining. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The doctor grabbed one and said "I'm a doctor, I save lives, so I must live," and jumped out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The lawyer then said, "I'm a lawyer and lawyers are the smartest people in the world. I deserve to live." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; He also grabbed a parachute and jumped. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The priest looked at the little boy and said, "My son, I've lived a long and full life. You are young and have your whole life ahead of you. Take the last parachute and live in peace." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The little boy handed the parachute back to the priest and said, "Not to worry, Father. The 'smartest man in the world' just took off with my back pack." &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </joke>
