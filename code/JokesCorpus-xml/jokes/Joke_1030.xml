<joke globalid="1030" localid="273" category="Adult-Jokes" name="Cigarette Warnings" source="http://www.coolfunnyjokes.com/Funny-Jokes/Adult-Jokes/Cigarette-Warnings.html">&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td colspan="2"&gt; Recent Canadian government research has shown that cigarette smoking not only impairs sexual ability, it actually causes shrinkage of the male sexual "equipment." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Wow! If that is true, we need to get the word out ASAP! Maybe the warning on the cigarette packs should be updated to reflect this new information. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; How about something like this: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; * Warning: These cigarettes are king size -- how about you? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; * Warning: Smoking sections in restaurants aren't the only things getting smaller. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; * Warning: If you don't reduce your smoking, your smoking will reduce you. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; * Warning: Smoking may lead to ridicule on your honeymoon. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; * Warning: Smoke rises, but you may not. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; * Warning: Second-hand smoke can be harmful to children -- That is.. if you're capable of conceiving any. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; * Warning: Cigarettes get shorter the more you puff -- so do you. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; * Warning: How can you enjoy a smoke afterwards, if there's no before? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; * Warning: The only thing left after a smoke is a dead stub. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; * Warning: Don't throw lit cigarettes in the urinal -- you might not have the range to put them out. </joke>
