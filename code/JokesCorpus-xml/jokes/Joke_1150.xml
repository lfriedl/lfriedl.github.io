"So I gave him a laxative and told him to take it all at once." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "Laxatives won’t cure a cough, you idiot," the owner shouts angrily. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "Sure it will," the clerk says, pointing at the man leaning on the wall. "Look at him. He’s afraid to cough." &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </joke>
