Both are dragging their right foot as they walk. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; As they meet, one man looks at the other knowingly, points to his foot and says, Vietnam, 1969." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The other points his thumb behind him and says, "Dog crap, 20 feet back." &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </joke>
