Upon their arrival, the doctor said he had invented a new machine that would transfer a portion of the mother's labour pain to the father. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; He asked if they were willing to try it out. They were both very much in favour of it. The doctor set the pain transfer dial to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; But as the labour progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and bump it up a notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. At this point they decided to try for 50%. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The husband continued to feel quite well. Since it was obviously helping out his wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer ALL the pain to him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The wife delivered a healthy baby with virtually no pain. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; She and her husband were ecstatic. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; When they got home, the mailman was lying dead on their porch. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </joke>
