But you have been sentenced to hell." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The worker agreed - not like he could do anything else - and he was on his way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; When he arrived, the devil looked at him and said, "Ah! A new slave. We shall burn you and throw you in the fiery pits." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Then the worker replied, "That wall could use a bit of patching. I could fix it first and you could throw me in the pit afterward." So he fixed the wall. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Satan, intrigued, asked, "What else can you build?" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; So the construction worker went about his job and made many improvements; in fact, by the time he was done, hell was a paradise. It had air conditioning, pools, balconies, you name it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Within a few days, God phoned Satan and said, "I think there has been a mix-up. That worker was originally supposed to come to heaven." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Satan replied, "No way -- he's built all sorts of useful stuff for us. We're keeping him." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; God then said, "Oh, yeah? Well, I'll see you in court. We're going to sue you for this man's soul and damages." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Satan just laughed: "And where are you going to find a lawyer?" &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </joke>
