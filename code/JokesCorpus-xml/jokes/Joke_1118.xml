Soon after the mother left, the baby started to cry. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The father did everything he could think of doing, but the baby wouldn't stop crying. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Finally, the dad got so worried that he decided to take the infant to the doctor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; After the doctor listened to the father relate all that he had done to get the baby to stop crying, the doctor began to examine the baby's ears, chest and then down to the diaper area. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; When he undid the diaper, he found that the diaper was indeed full. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "Here's the problem", the Dr. said, "He needs to be changed!" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The father was very perplexed, "But the diaper package says it is good for up to 10 lbs.!" &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </joke>
