He notices that he is really sun tanned all over except one part and he decides to do something about it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; He goes to the beach, completely undresses and buries himself in the dand except for the one part sticking out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Two little old ladies are strolling along the beach and one looks down and says, "There really is no justice in this world." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The other little old lady says, "What do you mean?" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The first little old lady says, "Look at that." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "When I was 10 years old, I was afraid of it." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "When I was 20 years old, I was curious about it." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "When I was 30 years old, I enjoyed it." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "When I was 40 years old, I asked for it." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "When I was 50 years old, I paid for it." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "When I was 60 years old, I prayed for it." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "When I was 70 years old, I forgot about it." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "And now that I'm 80, the damned things are growing wild!!" </joke>
