"You will be spending eternity here, but I'll let you pick your own room from three I'll show you," the devil said. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In the first room were thousands of people standing on their heads on a brick floor. "I don't like that," said the man. "Show me the second." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In the second room were thousands of people standing on their heads on a wood floor. "Well, that's better than brick," the man said, "but show me the third." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In the third, thousands of people were standing ankle-deep in a room full of maggot infested garbage, all drinking coffee. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "I'll choose this room," he said. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Into the room he went and the door slammed behind him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Immediately, the voice of a minor demon rang out, "OK, coffee break is over, back on your heads." &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </joke>
