The signal was given, and the nurse bayoneted the patient with the needle just as the dentist yanked the tooth. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Afterwards, the dentist asked, "Hurt much?" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The patient hesitated, "Didn't hardly feel it come out. And, man, those roots were really deep!" &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </joke>
