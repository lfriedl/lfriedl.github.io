The final straw came when she plugged in the vacuum cleaner and nothing happened. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; She looked so stricken that I had to offer some consolation. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "That's okay, honey," I said. "You still have me." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; She looked up at me with tears in her eyes. "Yes," she wailed, "but you don't work either!" &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </joke>
