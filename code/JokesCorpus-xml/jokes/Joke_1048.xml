Can you explain it to me first?" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "OK, Sweetheart. Putting it simply, we will call your private place 'the &lt;br /&gt; prison' and call my private thing 'the prisoner'. So what we do is: put the &lt;br /&gt; prisoner in the prison. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; And then they made love for the first time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Afterwards, the guy is lying face up on the bed, smiling with satisfaction. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Nudging him, his bride giggles, "Honey the prisoner seems to have escaped." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Turning on his side, he smiles. "Then we will have to re-imprison him." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; After the second time they spent, the guy reaches for his cigarettes but &lt;br /&gt; the girl, thoroughly enjoying the new experience of making love, gives him &lt;br /&gt; a suggestive smile, "Honey, the prisoner is out again!" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The man rises to the occasion, but with the unsteady legs of a recently &lt;br /&gt; born foal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Afterwards, he lays back on the bed, totally exhausted. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; She nudges him and says, "Honey, the prisoner escaped again." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Limply turning his head, He YELLS at her, "Hey, its not a life sentence, &lt;br /&gt; OKAY! </joke>
