Suddenly one bloke starts massaging the person in front's back. The other bloke immediately turns round and says to him, "What the hell do you think you're doing?" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The bloke behind tells him, "Well, I'm a chiropractor and I can't help myself. I can't help practicing my art." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "Are you crazy?" says the bloke in front, "I'm a lawyer, but do you see me f**king the bloke in front of me?" &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </joke>
