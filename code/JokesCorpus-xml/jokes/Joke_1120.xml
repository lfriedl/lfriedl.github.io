I don't know why you wear a bra; you've got nothing to put in it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; She said..You wear briefs, don't you &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; He said.. Do you love me just because my father left me a fortune? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; She said.. Not at all honey, I would love you no matter who left you the money. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; She said.. What do you mean by coming home half drunk? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; He said.. It's not my fault.. I ran out of money. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; He said.. Since I first laid eyes on you, I've wanted to make love to you in the worst way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; She said.. Well, you succeeded. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; He said.. What have you been doing with all the grocery money I gave you &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; She said.. Turn sideways and look in the mirror. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; He said.. Let's go out and have some fun tonight. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; She said.. Okay, but if you get home before I do, leave the hallway light on. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; He said.. Why don't you tell me when you have an orgasm? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; She said.. I would, but you're never there. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; He said.. Shall we try a different position tonight? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; She said.. That's a good idea, you stand by the ironing board while I sit on the sofa and fart. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </joke>
