Knowledge is Power. &lt;br /&gt; 2. Time is Money. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; As every engineer knows: &lt;br /&gt; Power = Work / Time &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Since: &lt;br /&gt; Knowledge = Power &lt;br /&gt; Time = Money &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; It follows that: &lt;br /&gt; Knowledge = Work/Money. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Solving for Money, we get: &lt;br /&gt; Money = Work / Knowledge. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Thus, as Knowledge approaches zero, Money approaches infinity, regardless of the amount of work done. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Conclusion: &lt;br /&gt; The less you know,the more you make. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </joke>
