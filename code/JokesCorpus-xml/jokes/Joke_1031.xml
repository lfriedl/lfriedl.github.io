There's your problem, it shrinks things, those silly American beers.. you should try drinking Guinness. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; That makes things grow." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Two months later the chap returns to the doctor with a big smile on his face. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; He shakes the doctor by the hand and thanks him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "I take it you now drink Guinness?" asked the doctor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "Oh no, Doc," replies the man, "but I've got the wife on American beer!" </joke>
