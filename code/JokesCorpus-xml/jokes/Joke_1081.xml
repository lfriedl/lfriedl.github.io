I thought these results were pretty interesting. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 85% of women think their ass has grown too big since getting married.. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 10% of women think their ass is just as big as it was when they got married.. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The other 5% say that they don't care, they love him and would have married him anyway. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </joke>
