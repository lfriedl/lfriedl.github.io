Q: How many members of the U.S.S. Enterprise does it take to change a light bulb? &lt;br&gt; A: Six-Scotty to get on the intercom when the light goes out and say "I canna do it, Cap'n! These bulbs are stoon dead", Spock to tell Kirk he is proceeding illogically, McCoy to say "They're BURNED-OUT, Jim!" and "Dammit Jim-I'm a doctor not an electrician!!", Kirk to screw it in, and two red-shirt security men to die in the process. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
