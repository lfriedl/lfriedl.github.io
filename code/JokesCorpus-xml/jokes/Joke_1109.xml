A woman is driving down the same road. As they pass each other the woman leans out the window and yells, "PIG!!" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The man immediately leans out his window and replies, "BITCH!!" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; They each continue on their way, and as the man rounds the next corner, he crashes into a pig in the middle of the road. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </joke>
