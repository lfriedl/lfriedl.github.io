"All this was just too wonderful for words," he said, "but what's the dollar for?" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "Well," she said, "last night, I told my husband that today would be your last day, and that we should do something special for you. I asked him what to give you." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; He said, "Fuck him, give him a dollar." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The lady then said, "The breakfast was my idea." </joke>
