I mean I fart all the time," &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The Doctor nods, "Hmm." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Patient, "My farts do not stink and you can't hear them. It's just that I fart all the time. Look, we've been talking here for about 10 minutes and I've farted five times. You didn't hear them and you don't smell them, do you?" &lt;br /&gt; "Hmm," says the Doctor, &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; He picks up his pad and writes out a prescription. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The patient is thrilled "Great doc. This prescription, will it really clear up my farts?" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "No," sighs the Doctor, "The prescription is to clear your sinuses. Next week I want you back here for a hearing test." &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </joke>
