He walks over and asks Paul what's wrong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "Well," replies Paul, "you know that beautiful girl at work that I wanted to ask out, but I got an erection every time I saw her?" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "Yes," replies Jeff with a laugh. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "Well," says Paul, straightening up, "I finally plucked up the courage to ask her out, and she agreed." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "That's great!" says Jeff, "When are you going out?" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "I went to meet her this evening," continues Paul, "but I was worried I'd get an erection again. So I got some duct tape and taped my penis to my leg, so if I did, it wouldn't show." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "Sensible" says Jeff. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "So I get to her door," says Paul, "and I rang her doorbell. She answered it in the sheerest, tiniest dress you ever saw." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "And what happened then?" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; (Paul slumps back over the bar again.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "I kicked her in the face." </joke>
