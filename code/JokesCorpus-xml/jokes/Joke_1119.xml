After a perfect courtship, they had a perfect wedding. Their life together was, of course, perfect. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; One snowy, stormy Christmas Eve this perfect couple was driving along a winding road when they noticed someone at the roadside in distress. Being the perfect couple, they stopped to help. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; There stood Santa Claus with a huge bundle of toys. Not wanting to disappoint any children on the eve of Christmas, the perfect couple loaded Santa and his toys into their vehicle. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Soon they were driving along delivering the toys. Unfortunately, the driving conditions deteriorated and the perfect couple and Santa Claus had an accident. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Only one of them survived the accident. Who was the survivor? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The perfect woman. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; She's the only one that really existed in the first place. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Everyone knows there is no Santa Claus and there is no such thing as a perfect man. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; * A Male's Response * &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; So, if there is no perfect man and no Santa Claus, the perfect woman must have been driving. This explains why there was a car accident. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </joke>
