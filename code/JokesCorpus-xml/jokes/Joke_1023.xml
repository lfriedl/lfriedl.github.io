The man was working hard cleaning the BBQ grill while his wife was bending over, weeding flowers from the flower bed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; So the man says to his wife "Your rear end is almost as wide as this grill!" She ignores the remark. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Later that night while in bed, her husband starts to feel frisky. The wife calmly responds, "If you think I'm gonna fire up the grill for one little wiener, you are sadly mistaken." </joke>
