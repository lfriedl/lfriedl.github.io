Is it because you think women are weak, dumb, cantankerous..or what?" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "Not at all, Ma'am," the manager replied. "It is because our employees are used to obeying orders, are accustomed to being shoved around, know how to keep their mouths shut and don't &lt;br /&gt; pout when I yell at them." &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </joke>
