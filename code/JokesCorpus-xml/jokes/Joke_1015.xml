After hours of effort he reached the top, jumped into the air waving his front legs and crashed to the ground. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; After recovering, he slowly climbed the tree again, jumped, and fell to the ground. The turtle tried again and again while a couple of birds sitting on a branch watched his sad efforts. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Finally, the female bird turned to her mate. "Dear," she chirped, "I think it's time to tell him he's adopted." &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </joke>
