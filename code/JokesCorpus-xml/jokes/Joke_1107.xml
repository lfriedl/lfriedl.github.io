A couple minutes later his eyes fluttered open and he said "You're cute!" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Well, the wife was dissapointed because instead of "beautiful" it was "cute." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; She said "What happened to 'beautiful'?" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; His reply was "The drugs are wearing off!" &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </joke>
