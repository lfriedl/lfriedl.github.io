The clerk looked really concerned, "Whatever happened to you, honey? You look like you've been wrestling an alligator!" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The bride groaned, hung on to the counter and managed to speak, "Ohhh God! He told me he'd been saving up for 75 years and I thought he meant his money!!" </joke>
