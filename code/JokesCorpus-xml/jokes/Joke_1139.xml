The butcher goes to the lawyer's office and asks, "if a dog, running unleashed, steals a piece of meat from my store, do I have a right to demand payment for the meat from the dog's owner?" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "Absolutely," the lawyer responded. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The butcher immediately shot back, "Good! You owe me $7.99 for the roast your dog stole from me this morning." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The lawyer, without a word, writes the butcher a check for $7.99. A few days later, the butcher, browsing through his mail, finds an envelope from the lawyer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The contents reads "Consultation: $25.00." &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </joke>
