Saint Peter meets them at the Gates and welcomes them saying "you can do as you please in Heaven, just don't step on any ducks." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The women are puzzled but proceed into Heaven. Looking around, they notice there are ducks everywhere. In a matter of minutes, one of the women steps on a duck. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Saint Peter walks up to the woman with a hideously ugly man. Saint Peter shackles the man and the woman together and says, "for stepping on a duck, you have to spend eternity chained to this ugly man." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The other two women are shocked but go about their business until, sure enough, another woman steps on a duck. Immediately Saint Peter comes and shackles her to another ugly man. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The last woman tries desperately to not step on a duck. After a few months of not stepping on any ducks, Saint Peter walks up to the woman accompanied by a stunningly handsome man. He shackles the woman to the man and after a while, the woman being thrilled to be chained to such a handsome man, says "I don't know what I did to deserve this." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The man replies, "I don't know what you did lady, but I stepped on a duck." &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </joke>
