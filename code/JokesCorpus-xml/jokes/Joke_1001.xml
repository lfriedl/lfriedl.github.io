The ticket girl said, "Sir, what is that on your shoulder?" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The old farmer said, "That is my pet rooster, Chuckie. Wherever I go, Chuckie goes." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "I'm sorry, Sir," said the ticket girl, "We can't allow animals in the theater. Not even a pet chicken." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The old farmer went around the corner and stuffed the chicken down his pants. He returned to the booth, bought a ticket and entered the theater. He sat down next to two old emergency room nurses named Mildred and Marge. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The movie started and the chicken began to squirm. The old farmer un-zipped his pants so Chuckie could stick his head out and watch the movie. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "Marge," whispered Mildred. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "What?" said Marge. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "I think the guy next to me is a pervert." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "What makes you think so?" asked Marge. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "He unzipped his pants and he has his thing out," whispered Mildred. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "Well, don't worry about it," said Marge, "At our age it isn't anything we haven't seen before." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; "Yes," said Mildred, "But this one's eating my popcorn!" &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </joke>
